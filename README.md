# PyGuymer3

This is a Python 3.X port of [my Python 2.X module](https://github.com/Guymer/PyGuymer) containing a bunch of random functions that I have written over the years.

## Dependencies

PyGuymer3 requires the following Python modules to be installed and available in your `PYTHONPATH`.

* [exifread](https://pypi.org/project/ExifRead)

## Notes

### The Zen of Python

```python
import this
```

## To Do

* Read this good [StackOverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21384492) describing type-checking which also provides a quick summary on [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/).

## Bugs

* This module has been created from [my Python 2.X module](https://github.com/Guymer/PyGuymer) using the utility `2to3`. As such, there may be bugs in the code as most of it has not been tested since the port. If you find anything wrong then please raise a bug report.
