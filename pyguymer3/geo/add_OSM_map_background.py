    # Add OpenStreetMap tiles ...
    # NOTE: By default, the background images appear to be drawn at a lower
    #       resolution than expected. For a long time, I believed that the
    #       images were drawn at 72 dpi and that either Cartopy or MatPlotLib
    #       were not dpi-aware. However, after cloning the Cartopy repository
    #       and adding some debugging statements (such as saving temporary
    #       arrays as images so that they can be viewed externally) I have now
    #       come to realise that the culprit is that, by default, Cartopy
    #       rescales all images such that their smallest dimension is 750
    #       pixels.
    # NOTE: When using a "cartopy.io.img_tiles()" class, two things happen:
    #         * all the required tiles are merged together to make a single
    #           image; and
    #         * the single image is warped to transform it from its own
    #           projection to the figure's projection.
    #       This all takes place in "lib/cartopy/mpl/geoaxes.py":
    #         * The definition of the "draw()" method loops over all image
    #           factories and uses the "image_for_domain()" method to make a
    #           single image of all of the tiles merged together before it calls
    #           the "imshow()" method.
    #         * However, the "imshow()" method that it calls is Cartopy's own
    #           method rather than MatPlotLib's method.
    #         * If the projection of the merged image is not the same as the
    #           figure's projection then the "warp_array()" function is used to
    #           transform the merged image to the figure's projection. No
    #           "*args" or "**kwargs" are passed to the "warp_array()" function
    #           call, so the user cannot alter how this is done **except** via
    #           the "regrid_shape" keyword argument which, by default, is 750.
    #         * This means that, even if the user provides a gigapixel image, it
    #           will be **downscaled** such that it's shortest dimension is only
    #           750 pixels.
    # NOTE: The size of a figure, in inches, can be found by calling
    #       "fg.get_size_inches()". The resolution of a figure can be found by
    #       interrogating "fg.dpi". The size of a figure, in pixels, can be
    #       found by multiplying the tuple by the scalar.
