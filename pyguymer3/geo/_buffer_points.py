    """Buffer some points

    This function reads in an array of coordinates (in degrees) that exist on
    the surface of the Earth and returns a [Multi]Polygon of them buffered by a
    constant distance (in metres).

    Parameters
    ----------
    points1 : numpy.array
            the (npoints, 2) array of (lon,lat) coordinates (in degrees)
    dist : float
            the distance to buffer the (lon,lat) coordinates by (in metres)
    debug : bool, optional
            print debug messages
    nang : int, optional
            the number of angles around the (lon,lat) coordinates that are calculated
    simp : float, optional
            how much intermediary [Multi]Polygons are simplified by; negative values disable simplification (in degrees)

    Returns
    -------
    buffs : shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon, shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon
            the buffered (lon,lat) coordinates
