    This function reads in a Polygon that should exist on the surface of
    the Earth and returns a [Multi]Polygon of the same Polygon existing on the
    surface of the Earth.

    Parameters
    ----------
    poly : shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon
            the Polygon
    tol : float, optional
            the Euclidean distance that defines two points as being the same (in degrees)

    Returns
    -------
    polys : shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon, shapely.geometry.multipolygon.MultiPolygon
            the re-mapped Polygon
