def _buffer_points_crudely(points1, dist, nang):
    """Buffer some points

    This function reads in an array of coordinates (in degrees) that exist on
    the surface of the Earth and returns an array of coordinates that are the
    rings around the input coordinates buffered by a constant distance (in
    metres).

    Parameters
    ----------
    points1 : numpy.array
            the (npoints, 2) array of (lon,lat) coordinates (in degrees)
    dist : float
            the distance to buffer the (lon,lat) coordinates by (in metres)
    nang : int
            the number of angles around the (lon,lat) coordinates that are calculated when buffering

    Returns
    -------
    points2 : numpy.array
            the (npoints, nang, 2) array of (lon,lat) coordinates around the (lon,lat) coordinates (in degrees)
