def _buffer_points_crudely(points1, dist, nang, kwArgCheck = None, debug = False, tol = 1.0e-10):
    """Buffer some points

    This function reads in an array of coordinates (in degrees) that exist on
    the surface of the Earth and returns an array of coordinates that are the
    rings around the input coordinates buffered by a constant distance (in
    metres).

    Parameters
    ----------
    points1 : numpy.ndarray
        the (npoint, 2) array of (lon,lat) coordinates (in degrees)
    dist : float
        the distance to buffer the (lon,lat) coordinates by (in metres)
    nang : int
        the number of angles around the (lon,lat) coordinates that are
        calculated when buffering (must be odd; must be ≥ 9)
    debug : bool, optional
        print debug messages
    tol : float, optional
        the Euclidean distance that defines two points as being the same (in
        degrees)

    Returns
    -------
    points2 : numpy.ndarray
        the (npoint, nang, 2) array of (lon,lat) coordinates around the
        (lon,lat) coordinates (in degrees)
